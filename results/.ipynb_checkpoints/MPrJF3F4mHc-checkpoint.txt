### Detailed Summary
The IT Security Labs channel on YouTube provides practical advice on skills that can be acquired through hands-on experience in information security. The channel emphasizes the importance of knowing both attacking and defending in the real world of information security. The Detection Lab is introduced as a critical tool for setting up a lab environment with Splunk. The GitHub repository from Chris Long is recommended as the base for all the labs used in the video. The Detection Lab in ESXi is shown to be simple to set up. The Windows Active Directory environment is used as the main attack target, with the DC (domain controller) as the machine to be broken into. The video shows how to do host-based detection using Splunk.

The video starts with the deployment of the DC machine, which is a Windows Active Directory domain controller machine. The IP address of the machine is obtained using nmap, which is a network mapper. The video explains that nmap is a lazy man's way of scanning a network and that it will not scan all the 65,000 ports. The video recommends scanning all TCP and UDP ports for CTF exams. The video shows how to filter through the overwhelming amount of information obtained from nmap to get some answers efficiently. The video explains that port 53 is DNS, and when it is running on a Windows machine, it is a good sign that it is a domain controller. Port 80 is checked, and port 8080 is found to be kebros, which is a dead giveaway that it is a Windows Active Directory machine. The video explains that the attack methodology matters, and a strategy that works and is stuck to is important. The video recommends checking port 84 to begin with, as it is the easiest thing to start with.

The video shows how to use the browser to check out port 80, which says "What are posts to be noticed? Confirm." The video explains that this is a common message on Windows machines and that it is not a vulnerability. The video shows how to use the browser to check out port 88, which is found to be LDAP. The video explains that LDAP is used for authentication and that it is a good sign that it is a Windows Active Directory machine. The video shows how to use the browser to check out port 389, which is also found to be LDAP. The video explains that the next step is to use the credentials obtained to log in to the machine. The video shows how to use the credentials to log in to the machine using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). The video explains that the next step is to escalate privileges to get administrative access. The video shows how to use the tool mimikatz to obtain the password of the administrator account. The video explains that mimikatz is a tool that is used to extract plaintext passwords, hash, PIN code, and kerberos tickets from memory. The video shows how to use the obtained password to log in to the machine as an administrator.

The video explains that the next step is to use the administrative access to perform Active Directory attacks. The video shows how to use the tool BloodHound to map the Active Directory environment. The video explains that BloodHound is a tool that is used to identify attack paths in Active Directory environments. The video shows how to use the obtained information to perform privilege escalation attacks. The video explains that the next step is to cover the tracks by deleting the logs. The video shows how to use the tool Sysmon to detect the deletion of logs. The video explains that Sysmon is a tool that is used to monitor system activity and detect suspicious behavior.

The article discusses the process of breaking into an Active Directory system by exploiting a misconfigured CMS web server. The author explains that administrators sometimes make the mistake of running a web server on a system without properly securing it, which can provide an entry point for attackers. The article then goes on to demonstrate how an attacker can exploit a vulnerability in the Write CMS version 3.1 to gain access to the system. The first step in the process is to identify the web server and determine if it is vulnerable. The author notes that CMS systems are often plagued with vulnerabilities, making them a prime target for attackers. In this case, the attacker discovers that the Write CMS server is running on the system and appears to be misconfigured. The next step is to exploit the vulnerability in the CMS system to gain access to the system. The author explains that one way to do this is to look for default credentials that may be used to log in to the system. In this case, the attacker discovers that the default credentials for the Write CMS system are admin/admin, which allows them to log in and gain access to the system.

Once the attacker has gained access to the system, they can then look for ways to escalate their privileges and gain access to the Active Directory system. The author notes that one way to do this is to look for services that are running on the system, such as SMB or network shares, that may be vulnerable to attack. In this case, the attacker discovers that the system is running SMB and is able to use a tool called Metasploit to exploit a vulnerability in the SMB service and gain access to the Active Directory system. The author notes that once an attacker has the ability to dump password hashes from an Active Directory environment, they have essentially owned the domain.

The article also discusses the importance of PowerShell logging in detecting and preventing attacks. The author demonstrates how PowerShell logging can be set up and used to detect malicious commands, even if they are obfuscated or encoded. The author also emphasizes the importance of using best practices, such as encoding payloads and using obscure formats, to maximize the chances of avoiding detection. The article provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up PowerShell logging using Splunk, a log management system. The author demonstrates how to configure Splunk to receive and analyze PowerShell logs, and how to create alerts for specific commands or events.

The author also shows how to use Splunk to analyze and visualize the logs, and how to search for specific events or patterns. The author then demonstrates how to use PowerShell to download and execute a payload, and how this activity is logged and detected by Splunk. The author shows how even failed commands are logged and can provide valuable information for detecting and preventing attacks. The article also provides resources for learning about Active Directory attacks, including a comprehensive list of known attacks and techniques.

The author emphasizes the importance of being familiar with these attacks and techniques, especially for those preparing for exams or job interviews in the field of pentesting or security. The article provides a practical and informative guide on how to use PowerShell logging and Splunk to detect and prevent attacks on Windows environments. The author emphasizes the importance of using best practices and being familiar with known attacks and techniques, and provides resources for further learning.

The author of the article discusses their interest in blue team certifications and their fascination with detection techniques. They mention their desire to become proficient in finding malicious activity and host-based detection, particularly with Sysmon PowerShell. The article also discusses a recent attack on an Active Directory machine, where the author demonstrated the importance of breaking in through a vulnerable service or application and using tools like Mimikatz to gain access.

The author also mentions the usefulness of Bloodhound in tying accounts found on a client to the Active Directory. The article concludes with the author expressing their excitement for the upcoming PNPT exam and their intention to try it after June. They also mention their interest in other blue team certifications and their desire to become proficient in incident response and detection techniques. Overall, the article provides insight into the author's interest in blue team certifications and their fascination with detection techniques. The author also demonstrates the importance of using vulnerable services and applications to gain access and the usefulness of tools like Mimikatz and Bloodhound in gaining access and tying accounts to the Active Directory. The article also encourages readers to set up their own labs and offers assistance to channel members.
