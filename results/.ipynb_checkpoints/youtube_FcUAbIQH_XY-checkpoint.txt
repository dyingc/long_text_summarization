#### Detailed Summary
In this thought-provoking article, the author explores the shifting dynamics of global power and the emergence of a leaderless world. They begin by highlighting the historical context, noting that the world used to be dominated by two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union. However, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States became the sole superpower, exerting its influence over global institutions and trade. 

The author identifies three key factors that have contributed to the current state of a leaderless world. Firstly, Russia's exclusion from Western institutions has led to its decline as a great power, resulting in frustration and anger. Secondly, China's integration into U.S-led institutions has not led to its transformation into an American-style power, but rather it has remained distinctly Chinese, which has caused discomfort for the United States. Lastly, the impact of globalization has left many citizens in wealthy democracies feeling left behind, leading to a sense of illegitimacy in their governments and leaders.

These three factors, according to the author, are responsible for the majority of geopolitical tensions and conflicts in the world today. As a result, the world is transitioning into a new order, characterized by three different orders that overlap to some extent. The first order is the Global Security order, where the United States and its allies hold the most power. The U.S. is the only country capable of deploying its military forces to any part of the world, making it the dominant player in global security. China's growing military capabilities in Asia have raised concerns among American allies in the region, leading to increased dependence on the United States for security. Similarly, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has heightened concerns among European allies, further strengthening the role of the U.S. and NATO in the security order.

The second order is the Global Economic order, where power is shared among different countries. While the United States remains a robust global economy, it cannot use its military dominance to dictate economic policies to other countries. The economic relationship between the U.S. and China is particularly significant, as they are economically interdependent. Other countries, such as the European Union, India, and Japan, also play important roles in the global economy. The author predicts that the global economic order will continue to be multipolar, with the rise and fall of different economies over the next decade.

Between the Global Security and Global Economic orders, tensions arise as the United States seeks to bring more economies under its influence, while other countries strive to maintain a balance of power. This tension is likely to persist as countries compete for dominance in both security and economic spheres.

The third order, which the author argues is the most important, is the Digital order. Unlike the other two orders, the digital order is not controlled by governments but by technology companies. These companies have immense power and influence over various aspects of our lives. The author highlights the role of technology companies in providing tools for defense against cyber attacks, enabling communication between leaders and soldiers, and shaping public discourse through social media platforms. The power of technology companies extends to determining our identities through algorithms, raising concerns about the erosion of individual freedom.

The author presents two possible scenarios for the future of the digital order. If China and the United States exert more control over the digital world and technology companies align with their respective governments, a technology Cold War could emerge, leading to a split in the digital order. On the other hand, if technology companies maintain global business models and competition between the digital and physical worlds continues, a new form of globalization could emerge. Alternatively, if technology companies become increasingly dominant and governments lose their capacity to govern, a techno polar order could emerge, with technology companies becoming the primary actors on the global stage.

The author concludes by raising important questions about the accountability of technology companies. They question how these companies will use their power as they develop and deploy artificial intelligence, collect vast amounts of data, and rely on advertising models that drive revenue but also contribute to hate and misinformation. The author emphasizes the need for technology companies to address these issues and act responsibly to ensure the preservation of democracy and individual freedom.

In summary, the article explores the transition from a bipolar and unipolar world to a leaderless world characterized by three overlapping orders: Global Security, Global Economic, and Digital. The author highlights the role of Russia's exclusion, China's integration, and the impact of globalization in shaping the current geopolitical landscape. They also discuss the tensions between the United States and other countries in both the security and economic orders. Finally, the author raises concerns about the power and accountability of technology companies in the digital order and calls for responsible action to safeguard democracy and individual freedom.
