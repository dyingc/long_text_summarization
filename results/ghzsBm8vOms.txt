### Detailed Summary
Platform engineering is a new concept in the DevOps and Cloud space that has emerged as a solution to the problems that led to the traditional way of working, where developers and operations worked in separate teams. The traditional way of working was an inflexible and slow process with developers waiting on operations when they needed any change in infrastructure or needed any infrastructure resources like additional servers or Jenkins pipeline for their applications. DevOps was introduced to unite those teams removing the inflexible and limiting process. However, with DevOps, there is one team that owns the application as well as the underlying runtime and infrastructure, which increases the flexibility and speed of work and efficiency, but naturally, it also adds tremendous cognitive load on the team because too many things that just few roles need to be responsible for.

Platform engineering is a solution to the problems faced by DevOps teams in managing the non-functional requirements of applications. Platform engineers standardize the usage of tools required for deploying and running applications across teams. These tools include version control systems, CI/CD pipelines, runtime environments like Kubernetes, underlying infrastructure like AWS Cloud platform, logging and monitoring, and proper security. Platform engineers take over the operation side of these tools, selecting standard tools, setting them up in one standard way with production and security best practices. This takes the load off application developers, allowing them to focus on creating business value.

Platform engineering distributes the pressure responsibility and the need for expertise among multiple application teams and one organization-wide platform team. Instead of each team deciding which CI/CD tool or Kubernetes cluster set up to use, the platform team offers a ready solution for the application teams. Platform engineers extract the need for expertise to administer these tools from the application teams, allowing them to focus on their core responsibilities. Platform teams also standardize pipeline steps with security scans, making sure that regulation-specific scans are part of every pipeline by default.

Platform engineering should not lead to siloed teams with separate responsibilities. Platform teams create an abstraction layer on top of the provisioned, configured, and secured services with a user-friendly interface like a UI or API. This allows application teams to self-service whatever services and tools they need without going to the platform team to ask for resources. This abstraction layer is called a platform as a service for the internal developer teams or an internal developer platform (IDP). Platform teams build the IDP, hiding away and abstracting the complexity of operating and managing the services that developers need to release and run their applications.

Platform engineering separates the two responsibilities of operating and managing the tools and using the tools. Platform teams apply their expertise to configure the tools properly so that they are secure, up to date, etc. They then create an abstraction layer on top with a user-friendly interface like a UI or API so that application teams can self-service whatever services and tools they need. Platform engineering is an improvement for application teams because it takes the load off the application developers. It also allows the expertise of engineers to be used more efficiently because instead of needing an expert on Kubernetes cluster administration in every team, there can be fewer in the platform engineering team who take over this work for all application teams.

Platform engineering standardizes the tools across teams, making it easier for application teams to access the services they need. Platform engineering is a solution to the problems faced by DevOps teams in managing the non-functional requirements of applications. The platform engineering team is responsible for standardizing the tools used across teams, but they also need to provide the flexibility for teams to use new modern tools or tools that fit better with their workflow. The platform team should not become a blocker and should help teams set up and configure their preferred tools with best practices.

The platform should offer a range of tools that teams can select from, and the platform team should add guardrails and pre-configurations to ensure security consistency and proper configuration. Infrastructure as code tools like Terraform, Ansible, or Pulumi can be used to create templates with baked-in best practice configurations, which can be used to automate provisioning of resources and offer flexibility for product teams to pass in various parameters based on their individual project needs to create and configure those services.

The article emphasizes that platform engineering is not a step backwards with Dev and Ops separated again. Instead, it is a step forward from DevOps, where the platform team takes off the load of application teams and creates consistency in the organization. The article also discusses the importance of avoiding strict rules not only in the selection of tools but also in the usage of those tools. The platform team should give developers flexibility in the usage of the tools as well. The platform team can integrate guardrails for using tools correctly into the IDP and make it part of the offering. Infrastructure as code or configuration is code templates can be used to create the templates with baked-in best practice configurations. These templates can be used to automate provisioning of resources and offer flexibility for product teams to pass in various parameters based on their individual project needs to create and configure those services. 

The article emphasizes the importance of an internal developer platform (IDP) and how it can be successfully implemented in a company. The author suggests that starting with a huge master concept and an ideal IDP or self-service platform is not the right approach. Instead, companies should take an agile approach and start with small steps that can immediately add value to at least one team right away. The IDP should be treated as a product that needs to be developed over time and continuously improved. The first step is to start with low hanging fruits, such as common tools that many teams use across the organization, and work closely with application teams to identify their pain points and offer solutions that make their work more efficient.

The article emphasizes the importance of human aspects and how to manage the work with application teams to create a culture of collaboration and clear responsibilities. The platform team should consider where the product teams are starting from and help them slowly move from the current state to the ideal state in steps. The platform team takes over the operations part while the application team is responsible for properly using the tools and integrating them into their development workflow. This means that companies still need DevOps engineers in product teams, but they now have shared their cognitive load and don't have to have deep expertise in cloud and Kubernetes and Helm charts, monitoring, security, compliance, development, and hundred other things because now they are focused on properly using those non-functional tools rather than operating them.

The article also highlights that the platform is also a product for the application teams, and the same way you need to add features, make the UI more user-friendly, offer services for new cool tools, fixed bugs in the platform, develop terraform modules, and using git Ops create pipelines for their infrastructure as code that is underlying the platform. The platform needs a continuous development with many feedback iterations and close input gathering from the end-users, which are mostly application teams but sometimes also governance and compliance people because they need access to the information about whether systems are compliant across organizations. All of these processes require DevOps because they're the same processes that we use in the application development. Therefore, companies may need a separate DevOps engineer role in the platform team as well.

In conclusion, the article suggests that implementing an internal developer platform requires an agile approach, treating the IDP as a product, starting with low hanging fruits, and working closely with application teams to identify their pain points and offer solutions that make their work more efficient. The platform team takes over the operations part while the application team is responsible for properly using the tools and integrating them into their development workflow.

All of these processes require DevOps because they're the same processes that we use in the application development. The article discusses the concept of platform engineering in the context of DevOps and Cloud computing. Platform engineering involves building a platform that developers or product teams can use to self-service any resources they need on top of the cloud resources and various other tools. Platform engineers need to have a wider range of knowledge of the tools outside the cloud alone, and they actually build a layer on top of Cloud with a bunch of cloud services as well as other services and
