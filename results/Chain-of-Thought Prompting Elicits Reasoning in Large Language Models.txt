#### Detailed Summary
The article titled "Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models" explores a method called chain-of-thought prompting, which aims to enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models. The authors highlight the limitations of scaling up language models in achieving high performance on challenging tasks such as arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning. To address this, they propose chain-of-thought prompting as a method to unlock the reasoning abilities of these models.

Chain-of-thought prompting involves providing exemplars consisting of triples: input, chain of thought, and output. The chain of thought represents a series of intermediate reasoning steps that lead to the final output. The authors demonstrate that large language models can generate chains of thought if demonstrations of chain-of-thought reasoning are provided in the exemplars for few-shot prompting.

The researchers conduct experiments on arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness of chain-of-thought prompting. They find that it improves performance on these tasks, with significant gains observed in some cases. For example, prompting a PaLM 540B model with just eight chain-of-thought exemplars achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems, surpassing even fine-tuned GPT-3 with a verifier.

The scalability of chain-of-thought prompting with different model sizes is also explored. The authors observe that the benefits of chain-of-thought prompting are more pronounced with larger models, indicating that chain-of-thought reasoning is an emergent ability of increasing model scale. Additionally, an ablation study is conducted to investigate the impact of different variations of chain-of-thought prompting. The inclusion of natural language reasoning steps in the chain of thought is found to be crucial for performance improvements.

The robustness of chain-of-thought prompting is evaluated by examining the impact of different annotators and exemplars. The authors find that while there is some variance among different chain-of-thought annotations, all sets of prompts outperform the standard baseline by a large margin. This suggests that successful use of chain of thought does not depend on a particular linguistic style.

The article also discusses the application of chain-of-thought prompting to commonsense reasoning tasks. The authors demonstrate that it improves the commonsense reasoning abilities of language models, with strong performance achieved on benchmarks such as StrategyQA and sports understanding.

Furthermore, the application of chain-of-thought prompting to symbolic reasoning tasks is investigated. The authors find that it enables language models to perform symbolic reasoning tasks that are challenging in the standard prompting setting. Additionally, chain-of-thought prompting facilitates length generalization to inference-time inputs longer than those seen in the few-shot exemplars.

In conclusion, the article presents chain-of-thought prompting as a powerful method for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models. The authors demonstrate its effectiveness in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks, highlighting the emergence of chain-of-thought reasoning as a result of model scale. The findings of this research have implications for expanding the range of tasks that language models can successfully perform and inspire further work on language-based approaches to reasoning.
