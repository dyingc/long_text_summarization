简要概述：
本文讨论了深度学习模型中的注意力机制，特别是在Transformer中的应用。注意力机制允许模型集中关注与任务相关的输入数据的某些部分。该机制涉及从输入数据中生成查询和键矩阵，然后使用它们计算权重矩阵，该矩阵确定每个标记应接收多少关注。权重矩阵是使用查询和键之间的外积计算的，这允许每个标记参与到每个其他标记的计算中。然后使用权重矩阵计算值的加权和，这是注意力机制的输出。

亮点：
- 🤖 注意力机制允许模型集中关注与任务相关的输入数据的某些部分。
- 🧠 注意力机制可以分解成部分以减少内存使用，但这会增加计算时间。
- 🤖 注意力自由Transformer使用从数据中学习的固定权重矩阵替换查询和键之间的外积。这允许更好的可扩展性，但固定权重矩阵不如原始注意力机制强大。
- 🧠 rwkv是一种新方法，它学习一个向量而不是权重矩阵。该向量定义了过去对隐藏状态的每个维度的影响程度，并根据标记与过去的距离以及涉及其历史的维度的影响程度计算每个标记的权重。这个权重然后被一个依赖于当前标记的键值调制。这种方法在注意力自由Transformer的灵活性和原始注意力机制的可扩展性之间取得了平衡。

本文讨论了一种名为TimeSformer的新型神经网络架构，它是自然语言处理中使用的Transformer架构的变体。TimeSformer旨在处理视频数据，这是一种顺序数据类型，不同于文本数据。TimeSformer类似于Transformer，因为它使用自我注意机制来处理输入数据，但它还包括一种称为Time Mixing模块的新类型模块，该模块允许其处理顺序数据。

亮点：
- 🎥 TimeSformer旨在处理视频数据，这是一种顺序数据类型，不同于文本数据。
- 🤖 TimeSformer类似于Transformer，因为它使用自我注意机制来处理输入数据，但它还包括一种称为Time Mixing模块的新类型模块，该模块允许其处理顺序数据。
- 🎥 TimeSformer由模型的重复应用组成，其中相同的模型连续应用于三个标记。模型由一列组成，它有一个开始，即标记嵌入，一个结束，即语言建模头，中间由一系列层组成。每个层都有一个Time Mix模块和一个Channel Mix模块，这些模块在序列中重复出现。
- 🤖 TimeSformer的Channel Mixing块类似于具有一个非线性和一个遗忘门的前馈神经网络。Channel Mixing块中的线性层混合通道，这意味着每个维度都可以从每个其他维度获得输入。Time Mixing块始终从上一个时间步骤获取输入，并在当前输入和上一个输入之间进行线性插值。这意味着TimeSformer不仅像一般的RNN一样获取当前输入和之前的隐藏状态，而且还获取当前输入、上一个输入和隐藏状态。
- 🎥 TimeSformer还有第二行，即状态。Time Mixing模块是模型的实际循环部分。TimeSformer计算R，这只是X tilde乘以W乘以前馈层，然后成为带有逐元素乘法的遗忘门。TimeSformer还有一个输出前馈层，它是可以更改维度和其他参数的投影。
- 🤖 TimeSformer可以在时间并行和时间顺序模式下使用，使其灵活且适应不同的用例。

### Detailed Summary
The article discusses two new neural network architectures, the TimeSformer and the Performer, which are designed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of processing sequential data such as videos, audio, and natural language. The TimeSformer is based on the Transformer architecture, which has been successful in natural language processing tasks, but it uses a temporal convolutional layer instead of an attention mechanism to process the input sequence. This allows the TimeSformer to process the entire input sequence at once and mix information across time, making it a powerful tool for video and audio processing tasks. The TimeSformer can be used in both time-parallel and time-sequential modes, making it flexible and adaptable to different use cases.

The Performer, on the other hand, is designed to improve the efficiency of attention mechanisms in natural language processing tasks. The model uses a linear attention mechanism, which allows it to scale more efficiently than traditional attention mechanisms. The Performer performs similarly to other similarly sized Transformers, but there are some qualitative differences that need to be explored further. The model is able to scale more efficiently than traditional attention mechanisms because it uses a linear attention mechanism, which allows it to perform well on language modeling tasks. However, the model has limitations, including its inability to recall minutiae information over very long contexts, which may make it less effective for tasks that require recalling such information.

The article notes that more research is needed to determine the qualitative differences between the Performer and other models, as well as to explore the limitations of the model's recurrent architecture. The article concludes with a discussion of some interesting experiments that were conducted with the Performer, including a visualization of how the model considers past information at different layers and a demonstration of how the model processes input tokens. The visualization showed that as the model moves up the layers, it considers the past more and more, while the demonstration showed that the model processes input tokens in a way that allows it to carry information from lower layers to higher layers.

The TimeSformer is a new type of neural network architecture that is designed to process sequential data, specifically video data. The TimeSformer is similar to the Transformer architecture used in natural language processing, but it includes a new type of module called the Time Mixing module, which allows it to process sequential data. The TimeSformer has the same trade-offs as attention-free Transformers, but it is composed of a recurrent application of the model, where the same model is applied to three tokens in succession. The model is composed of one column, and it has a beginning, which is a token embedding, an end, which is a language modeling head, and in the middle, it is composed of a series of layers. Each layer has a Time Mix module and a Channel Mix module, which are repeated in a sequence. The purpose of the left branches of these computations is to make a decision about how much of the input signal to accept and send up to the next layer.

The Channel Mixing block is similar to a feed-forward neural network with one non-linearity and a forget gate as another non-linearity. The linear layers in the Channel Mixing block mix the channels, which means that every dimension can get inputs from every other dimension. The Time Mixing block always takes the input from the last time step and linearly interpolates between the current input and the last input. This means that the TimeSformer not only takes the current input and the hidden state from before, like in a general RNN, but it also takes the current input, the last input, and the hidden state onto these.

The TimeSformer also has a second line, which are the states. The Time Mixing module is the actual recurrent part of the model. The TimeSformer computes R, which is just X tilde times W times a feed-forward layer, and that becomes the forget gate with an element-wise multiplication. The TimeSformer also has an output feed-forward layer, which is a projection that can change the dimensionality and other parameters. The K and V are computed similarly to the original Transformer architecture, which is just the input times a linear layer.

The Performer is a new type of neural network architecture that is designed to improve the efficiency of attention mechanisms in natural language processing tasks. The model uses a linear attention mechanism, which allows it to scale more efficiently than traditional attention mechanisms. The Performer performs similarly to other similarly sized Transformers, but there are some qualitative differences that need to be explored further. The model is able to scale more efficiently than traditional attention mechanisms because it uses a linear attention mechanism, which allows it to perform well on language modeling tasks. However, the model has limitations, including its inability to recall minutiae information over very long contexts, which may make it less effective for tasks that require recalling such information.

The article notes that more research is needed to determine the qualitative differences between the Performer and other models, as well as to explore the limitations of the model's recurrent architecture. The article concludes with a discussion of some interesting experiments that were conducted with the Performer, including a visualization of how the model considers past information at different layers and a demonstration of how the model processes input tokens. The visualization showed that as the model moves up the layers, it considers the past more and more, while the demonstration showed that the model processes input tokens in a way that allows it to carry information from lower layers to higher layers.

Overall, both the TimeSformer and the Performer are promising new neural network architectures that have the potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of processing sequential data. The TimeSformer's ability to process the entire input sequence at once and mix information across time makes it a powerful tool for video and audio processing tasks, while the Performer's linear attention mechanism allows it to scale more efficiently than traditional attention mechanisms in natural language processing tasks. However, more research is needed to fully understand the capabilities and limitations of both models.
