#### Detailed Summary (344 words)
The research on adversarial attacks and defenses in deep learning has been conducted by the Rehnquist team from Jaejoong University in collaboration with the University of Toronto and McGill University. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning technologies have made significant advancements and achieved remarkable performance in various applications such as image classification, natural language processing, autonomous vehicles, and speech recognition. However, as these technologies continue to develop rapidly, it has become increasingly crucial to ensure the security and robustness of deep learning algorithms.

Adversarial attacks pose a significant security issue for deep learning models. Adversaries can manipulate a well-performing model to exhibit incorrect behavior by adding small perturbations to benign samples. These manipulated samples, known as adversarial examples, can have serious consequences, particularly in security-critical areas. For instance, in autonomous driving, if an adversary modifies a stop sign, the object detection system of vehicles may misclassify it, leading to potentially disastrous accidents.

In recent years, numerous research efforts have emerged in the field of adversarial attacks. The existing research has been summarized, and the current state and future directions of this work have been discussed. The research begins by establishing the theoretical basis of adversarial attacks, including the fundamental concepts and attack settings. It then delves into describing various general attack algorithms in detail. Additionally, practical application cases of adversarial attacks in different domains are presented, providing readers with a comprehensive understanding of the theory of adversarial attacks and their security threats in real-world scenarios.

To address these security concerns, several representative defense technologies have been introduced. These include heuristic defenses, adversarial training, denoising, randomization, and certified defenses that utilize mathematical methods. These defense technologies aim to enhance the security and robustness of deep learning models based on specific needs and characteristics.

Finally, the current status of adversarial attacks and defenses in AI technology is analyzed and discussed. The development trends and several unresolved challenges in this critical area are highlighted. The article concludes by encouraging further research efforts to tackle these challenges and improve the security of deep learning algorithms.
