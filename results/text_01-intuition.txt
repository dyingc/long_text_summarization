#### Title (5 words)
Diffusion Modeling in Neural Networks

#### Short Synopsis (37 words)
Diffusion modeling is a technique used in neural networks to generate new sprites that are not represented in the training data set. It involves adding noise to images and training the network to remove the noise progressively.

#### Key Points (85 words)
- Diffusion modeling generates new sprites by adding noise to images and training a neural network to remove the noise.
- The concept of adding noise is inspired by the diffusion of ink in water.
- The neural network is trained to make judgments about the image at different levels of noise.
- Training involves reconstructing the original sprite from images that are pure noise.
- By training the network in this way, it can generate new sprites not present in the training data set.

#### Detailed Summary (415 words)
The goal of diffusion models is to generate more sprites that are not represented in the training data set. This is achieved by using a neural network that can generate new sprites through a process called diffusion modeling. To make the training data useful to the neural network, different levels of noise are added to the images. This noise serves to emphasize finer details or general outlines of the sprites.

The concept of adding noise to the images is inspired by physics, specifically the diffusion of ink in water. Just as an ink drop diffuses into the water until it disappears, the noise added to the images gradually obscures the original sprite until it becomes unrecognizable. At each level of noise, the neural network is trained to make certain judgments about the image.

When the image is still clearly recognizable as the original sprite, the neural network should identify it as such. As more noise is added, the network should recognize that there is some noise present and suggest possible details to make it look more like the original sprite. When only the outline of a sprite is visible, the network should suggest more general details that could belong to any likely sprite. Even when the image appears to be completely noise, the network should still try to make it look more like a sprite by proposing an outline of what a sprite might look like.

The process of adding noise progressively to the images is demonstrated through an animation of an ink drop diffusing in water. This visual representation helps to illustrate the concept of diffusion modeling and how the noise gradually obscures the original sprite.

Training the neural network involves teaching it to remove the noise that was added to the images. The network starts with images that are pure noise and gradually learns to reconstruct the original sprite. The "No Idea" level of noise is particularly important because it is normally distributed, meaning that each pixel is sampled from a normal distribution or a bell-shaped curve. This allows for the generation of new sprites by sampling noise from the normal distribution and using the neural network to remove the noise progressively.

By training the neural network in this way, it becomes capable of generating new sprites that were not present in the original training data set. This allows for the expansion of the sprite collection beyond what was initially available. The next video in the series will cover the topic of sampling.
