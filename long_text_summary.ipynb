    "# final_summary = ['''In this article, the author interviews Jared Zonnerak, the co-founder of PromptLayer, a collaborative platform for teams and individuals to track, debug, and explore their language model application requests. The conversation revolves around the common denominator that all language model practitioners share: the prompt. Zonnerak explains that prompt engineering is a skill set that involves tinkering with the prompt to optimize the output of language models. He believes that prompt engineering is not just for engineers, but also for product managers and non-technical stakeholders.\\n\\nPromptLayer was launched in January and has since gained popularity among developers and teams. The platform provides a one-line code setup that allows users to track and analyze their logs, save prompt templates, and gain insights through analytics. It caters to both indie developers and teams, with features specifically designed for collaboration between technical and non-technical stakeholders.\\n\\nZonnerak discusses the journey of PromptLayer since its launch, highlighting the feature updates and the recent addition of support for the anthropic language model. The company has also raised funding to support its growth and is currently looking to hire a founding engineer.\\n\\nLooking ahead, Zonnerak shares that PromptLayer\\'s roadmap includes focusing on improving the product for both hackers and teams. They aim to build workflows that allow teams to work on prompts collaboratively and efficiently. They are also working on features like unit testing and backtesting prompts, as well as A/B testing capabilities.\\n\\nThe conversation then shifts to the challenges of being a founder in the AI space and dealing with the constant influx of news and information. Zonnerak acknowledges the noise but emphasizes the importance of staying rooted in the needs and feedback of actual users. He believes that prompt engineering is a skill set that will continue to evolve and become more important in the future, with product managers potentially taking ownership of it.\\n\\nWhen asked about prominent prompt engineers in the industry, Zonnerak explains that prompt engineering is still a relatively new field and there are no defined experts or certifications. He suggests following builders and developers who are actively shipping products rather than those who only talk about prompt engineering. He also mentions the dynamics of how teams interact with prompts, explaining that before using PromptLayer, teams often relied on tools like Google Docs or databases to manage prompts.\\n\\nThe conversation then delves into the future of prompting, with Zonnerak sharing his belief that prompts will always be necessary, even as language models become more intelligent. He argues that humans themselves rely on prompts when communicating with each other, and prompts serve as a starting point for language models. He also highlights the importance of other variables in prompt engineering, such as the choice of model, temperature, and user segmentation.\\n\\nZonnerak recommends practicing prompt engineering by playing around with language models in playgrounds like OpenAI\\'s playground. He also suggests reading Stephen Wolfram\\'s articles on language models to gain a better understanding of the underlying technology.\\n\\nThe article concludes with Zonnerak discussing the serendipitous moments and challenges of attending events in the AI space. He mentions some under-the-radar companies he is excited about, such as Great for code refactoring and DeepTune for podcast dubbing AI. Zonnerak also shares his love for books and recommends Nassim Nicholas Taleb\\'s \"Antifragile\" and \"Skin in the Game.\"\\n\\nIn closing, Zonnerak advises developers and entrepreneurs to \"just ship it\" and not spend too much time strategizing. He encourages early product releases and invites readers to check out PromptLayer and connect with him on Twitter or via email.''']\n",

    "# to_summary = \"\"\"In this article, the author discusses the use case for topic modeling and how it can be applied to various types of content, such as YouTube videos, podcasts, meeting notes, legal documents, movie scripts, books, and lecture notes. The author highlights the manual work involved in extracting topics from these sources and emphasizes the value of structured data in these contexts.\\n\\nThe author suggests that there is an opportunity to create a productionized service for extracting topics from podcasts and videos. They provide an example of a podcast website that does not have topics listed on their episodes, and propose the idea of offering a service to extract and provide topics for these episodes. This approach could be replicated for other podcasts, videos, or any series of information.\\n\\nThe author then introduces their tutorial on topic modeling, specifically focusing on a two-pass approach. In the first pass, they use a mapreduce method to process the entire document and extract topics and bullet points. They explain that this approach may be a bit expensive in terms of computational resources, but it allows for a comprehensive analysis of the text. In the second pass, they iterate through each topic bullet point and expand on them using a retrieval method. This involves a question and answer-like process to provide more detailed information and context.\\n\\nThe author makes several assumptions, including the absence of a table of contents or contents, and the desire for more control over the topic modeling process. They emphasize the importance of learning the ins and outs of building with AI and encourage readers to experiment with their own use cases.\\n\\nThe article then delves into the technical implementation of the topic modeling process. The author imports various packages and sets up two language models, GPT 3.5 Turbo and GPT 4. They load the transcript that will be parsed and split it into chunks using a recursive character text splitter. The author explains the reasoning behind the chunk size and overlap parameters, highlighting the need for experimentation based on individual use cases.\\n\\nNext, the author focuses on extracting topic titles and short descriptions. They create a custom prompt to instruct the language model on the desired output. They provide examples and formatting guidelines to ensure accurate extraction of topics. The author then runs the mapreduce method using the GPT 4 language model and consolidates the results to eliminate duplicates.\\n\\nThe article continues with the conversion of the extracted topics into structured data. The author defines a schema with properties for topic name, description, and tag. They demonstrate the structured data output for the extracted topics, showcasing the potential value of this approach.\\n\\nMoving on to the second pass of topic expansion, the author introduces the concept of using a retrieval method and the vector store dance. They explain that this approach allows for generating longer descriptions or summaries based on specific topics. The author sets up a custom prompt for this process and creates embeddings using the OpenAI embeddings engine. They initialize Pinecone, a remote vector store, and set up the retrieval QA process.\\n\\nThe author demonstrates how to iterate through the structured topics and generate expanded summaries using the retrieval method. They provide examples of the expanded topics, showcasing the additional information and context that can be obtained through this process.\\n\\nFinally, the author explores the topic of extracting chapters or timestamps from a transcript. They create a custom prompt for this purpose and use the retrieval QA process to find the first timestamp associated with each topic. The author provides an example of the retrieved timestamps and highlights the relevance of this information in organizing and navigating through content.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the article presents a comprehensive overview of topic modeling and its applications in various contexts. The author provides step-by-step instructions and technical details for implementing a two-pass approach to extract and expand on topics. They emphasize the value of structured data and the potential for creating productionized services based on topic modeling.\"\"\"\n",

      "#### Detailed Summary (639 words)\n",
      "The article is a transcript of a video introducing a machine learning course taught by Professor Li Hongyi. The video provides information about the course schedule, classroom arrangements, and the use of live streaming for lectures. It also discusses the course requirements, including the completion of assignments and the absence of midterm and final exams. The course is designed to be completed online, allowing students to listen to lectures and submit assignments remotely.\n",
      "\n",
      "The course assumes that students have a basic understanding of mathematics, including calculus, linear algebra, and probability. It also assumes that students are familiar with Python programming. While the course focuses on deep learning techniques, it serves as an introduction to machine learning as a whole. The instructor emphasizes that deep learning is a widely used and highly regarded technique in the field of machine learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The course covers a wide range of topics, including computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. The assignments are designed to provide hands-on experience with these applications. For example, students will work on tasks such as image classification, image generation, translation, question answering, speech recognition, and reinforcement learning in gaming.\n",
      "\n",
      "All course materials, including lecture recordings and assignment instructions, are available on the course website. The instructor recommends that students watch the lecture recordings in the \"pre\" section of the website, as they provide the necessary background knowledge for completing the assignments. The lectures are designed to be self-contained, allowing students to choose how much they want to learn beyond the required material.\n",
      "\n",
      "The assignments are graded based on a report and a leaderboard. The report consists of a set of questions that students need to answer, while the leaderboard ranks students based on their performance. The instructor emphasizes that the leaderboard is not the sole determinant of a student's grade, as the final grade is based on the highest scores from ten out of the fifteen assignments. The instructor also mentions that completing all fifteen assignments with a score of nine or above in each assignment will earn students a special reward.\n",
      "\n",
      "The instructor provides some disclaimers and guidelines for the course. He clarifies that the course does not teach Python programming or the use of specific packages, such as PyTorch. The teaching assistants are available to answer questions related to machine learning and PyTorch, but they may not be able to assist with other topics. The instructor also acknowledges that training deep neural networks can be time-consuming and frustrating, but encourages students to persevere and not get discouraged by slow progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "The instructor emphasizes the importance of academic integrity and warns against plagiarism. Students are not allowed to copy others' work or directly use others' model results. The instructor also advises against using public datasets or searching for answers online, as this violates the course rules. Students are expected to train their models using the provided training data and submit their own results.\n",
      "\n",
      "The course offers an opportunity for students to apply for an exemption from the course requirements. Students from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, as well as related disciplines, can apply for an exemption by filling out a Google form. The instructor mentions that the exemption is not guaranteed and will be determined on a case-by-case basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The instructor concludes by providing information about office hours and support for students. There will be online TA hours and in-person TA hours for students to ask questions and seek assistance. Students are encouraged to use the online forum for general questions, and to email the teaching assistants for more specific or private inquiries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the article provides a detailed overview of the machine learning course, including the course structure, assignments, guidelines, and support available to students. It emphasizes the importance of academic integrity and the need for students to take responsibility for their own learning.\n",

It also mentions that there is no midterm or final exam, and the course can be completed entirely online. The video encourages students to complete as many assignments as possible but emphasizes that only the highest-scoring ten assignments will be considered for the final grade.\n",
      "\n",
      "The video introduces the use of the Cargo platform for submitting assignments and viewing the leaderboard. It explains that the leaderboard shows the rankings of students based on their assignment scores and mentions that there is a public leaderboard and a hidden leaderboard. The public leaderboard shows real-time rankings, while the hidden leaderboard is only revealed at the end of the course.\n",
      "\n",
      "The video emphasizes the importance of academic integrity and warns against plagiarism. It states that copying others' work, including code and reports, is strictly prohibited.
